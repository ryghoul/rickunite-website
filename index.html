      <p>I’m a 21-year-old Filipino-American from Carson, California, and a fourth-year Electrical Computer Engineering major at Cal Poly Pomona. I thrive at the intersection of theory and hands-on innovation, channeling my love of circuitry and code into creative projects that let me bring ideas to life. When I’m not designing or debugging, you’ll find me watching movies for inspiration, expressing myself through dance, or dreaming up my next build.</p>

        I attended Cal Poly Pomona studying my Bachelor’s in Electical Computer Engineering! I decided to do ECE because I was very interested in working with Computer Science software, but I also liked working with the hardware of Electrical Engineering. I took various classes such as Digital Verilog Design, Control Systems Engineering, Electrical Circuit Analysis. My favorite class was Microelectronics, dealing with diodes, transistors and BJTs.

          <h3>Disney Imagineer Competition</h3>
          <p>Participated in a Disney Imagineer Competition. I participated with my friends Joseph Kim and Claire Ku. We designed a company called LAPS. The purpose of the app was to better the structure of the public transport system within LA! We would have various hubs that would connect to a main hub. Shuttles were used to connect these hubs to conduct easier transport within the busy city and reduce traffic. This would lead to less carbon emission within our atmosphere and overall a more happier, public transport efficient city. I was in charge of the 3D model design of the trains and the app configuration, Claire created all the drawings of where our hubs would be and found their proper locations in correlation with an IRL map, and Joe created our project proposal/story.</p>

        <h3>FPGA Doodle Jump</h3>
        <p>Leveraging a Digilent Nexys A7-100T FPGA, I implemented the classic Doodle Jump game entirely in Verilog. I designed a VGA controller to generate 640×480 @ 60 Hz timing and double-buffered sprite rendering for the jumper and moving platforms, and built a hardware physics engine to model gravity, jump dynamics, and collision detection. User input is mapped to push-buttons with dead-zone filtering to ensure smooth left/right movement, while a pseudo-random platform generator based on an LFSR keeps gameplay unpredictable. Onboard clock management divides the 100 MHz system clock into a 25 MHz pixel clock for VGA timing and slower clocks for game logic, and I added simple audio feedback via the onboard speaker for scoring events. This project showcases my expertise in synchronous digital design, finite-state machines, timing-critical interfaces, and resource-efficient hardware implementation.</p>

        <h3>Microcontrollers Stoplight</h3>
        <p>Using the Microchip PIC18F4620 and MPLAB X IDE, I built a fully autonomous stoplight simulator in C. I mapped the red, yellow, and green LEDs to digital output pins and configured the PIC’s oscillator and configuration bits for an 8 MHz system clock. A hardware timer (Timer0) with interrupt-driven overflow provided precise millisecond timing, driving a finite‐state machine that cycles through red, green, and yellow phases with configurable durations. I also implemented a debounced push-button input for a pedestrian‐crossing request, which temporarily inserted a walk signal into the sequence. Throughout the project, I used MPLAB X’s simulator and on-chip debugger to verify timing, validate state transitions, and optimize code size and performance—demonstrating hands-on expertise in microcontroller configuration, interrupt handling, and embedded systems design.</p>

        <h3>MagicMirror Smart</h3>
        <p>I built a fully custom smart mirror using the open-source MagicMirror² framework hosted on GitHub and powered by a Raspberry Pi. On the software side, I cloned the MagicMirror² repo, installed it on Raspbian, and customized modules to display time, weather, calendar events, and headline news. For the hardware, I hand-crafted a wooden frame from raw planks I cut and sanded myself, and fitted a sheet of two-way mirror glass into it. I then stripped down an old monitor to its bare LCD panel and mounted it directly behind the glass, connecting it to the Pi. The result is a seamless, wall-mounted smart mirror that combines embedded Linux, hardware hacking, carpentry, and open-source software customization into a polished, functional installation.</p>

        <h3>Cafe Sumire Website</h3>
        <p>I designed and built a bespoke, responsive website for Café Sumire—TJ Ige and Nera Castro’s specialty coffee shop—using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. The site opens with a full-screen video hero overlaid by the café’s tagline in a stylish serif font, and a fixed navbar that smoothly transitions from transparent to solid as you scroll. I crafted a custom color palette of sea green, ivory, charcoal gray, and royal blue accents, and leveraged CSS Grid and Flexbox to showcase the menu: each signature drink appears in a card layout with click-to-open modals for ingredients and tasting notes. An About section tells TJ and Nera’s story with professional photography, while the Contact page features a custom form (powered by Email.js) and an embedded Google Map for easy directions. Mobile-first breakpoints ensure the site looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops alike, and I organized the CSS into modular components for easy future updates. The result is a polished, brand-aligned web presence that highlights Café Sumire’s atmosphere and makes it effortless for customers to explore the menu and get in touch.</p>

The system exposes a RESTful API for creating, updating, and tracking customer tickets, while a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend gives café staff an intuitive interface to manage orders in real time. I orchestrated services with Docker Compose, configured network routing and secure HTTPS endpoints, and tuned firewall rules to ensure reliable, secure communication between microservices and the web client. This solution streamlined the café’s order workflow, reduced service bottlenecks, and highlights my expertise in backend and frontend development, containerization, cloud deployment, and network configuration.
